            <h1>The Raven</h1>
            <h2>by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
            <p> Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
                While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
                As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
                “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
                Only this and nothing more.”<br>
            </p>
            <p> Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
                And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
                Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
                From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
                For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
                Nameless <span>here</span> for evermore.<br>
            </p>
            <p> And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
                Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
                So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
                “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
                Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
                This it is and nothing more.”
            </p>
             <p>
                Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
                “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
                But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
                And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
                That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
                Darkness there and nothing more(...)<br>
